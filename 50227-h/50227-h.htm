<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The writer of a thumb-nail biography of Richard
Strauss finds himself confronted with a troublesome
assignment. Strauss lived well beyond the scriptural
age allotted the average man. He would have been 86
had he reached his next birthday. There was nothing
romantic or sensational about his passing, for he died
of a complication of the illnesses of old age. There
was not much truly spectacular about the course of
his life, which was most happily free from the material
troubles which bedeviled the existence of so
many great masters; and he was not called upon to
starve or to struggle to achieve the material rewards
of his gifts. He had not to pass through the conflicts
which embittered the lives of Wagner or Berlioz, and
he was never compelled to suffer like Mozart or
Schubert. There is no record of his ever humiliating
himself or performing degrading chores for publishers
in return for a wretched pittance. He had wealth
enough without compromising his art to keep the pot
boiling&mdash;and for this one can only feel devoutly
thankful. What if he was taxed with sensationalism?
How many of the masters of music has not had at one
time or another to endure this reproach? If &ldquo;Salome&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Elektra&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ein Heldenleben&rdquo; and &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rdquo;
were in their day scandalously &ldquo;sensational&rdquo;
did not the whirligig of time reveal them as incontestable
products of genius, irrespective of inequalities
and flaws? However Richard Strauss compares
in the last analysis with this or that master he contributed
to the language of music idioms, procedures
and technical accomplishments typical of the confused
years and conflicting ideals out of which they
were born. His works are most decidedly of an age,
whether or not they are for all time! In a way he was
almost as fortunate as Mendelssohn. Need anyone begrudge
him this?</p>

<h1 title="">RICHARD STRAUSS</h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p>The late spring of 1864 brought two events which,
though seemingly unrelated, actually had a kind of
mystic kinship and were to stir the surfaces of
music. Early in May of that year Richard Wagner
was summoned to Munich to become the friend and
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the young Bavarian sovereign, Ludwig II,
whose real mission on earth was to save the composer
for the world. Hardly more than a month later there
was born in the same city a boy likewise named
Richard who was destined in the fullness of time to
become in a sense an heir and continuator of the
older master, though by no means a vain copy of his
artistic and spiritual lineaments. And long before the
span of his days reached its end he had taken an
undisputed place in history as a seminal force in
music, for all the disagreements and conflicts his art
was to engender through a large part of his more
than four-score years.</p>
<p>Richard Strauss first saw the light on June 11, 1864,
in a house on the Altheimer Eck, Munich, at the
center of the town and a stone&rsquo;s throw from the twin
steeples of the Frauenkirche. The edifice in which
the future composer of <i>Salome</i>, <i>Elektra</i> and <i>Der
Rosenkavalier</i> was born forms part of a complex of
buildings in which a number of larger and smaller
beer halls and restaurants, separated by cobbled courtyards,
house the brewery of Georg Pschorr, senior,
whose son, Georg Pschorr, junior, enlarged the establishment.
Furthermore, he improved the quality of
its products till Pschorrbrau beer became, it seemed
to many (including the writer of these pages) the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
most incomparable refreshment this side of heaven,
despite the close proximity of the Hofbrauhaus, the
L&ouml;wenbrau, the Augustiner Brau and the unnumbered
other Munich breweries and affiliated Bierstuben. At
this point the writer ought, logically, to confess that
he bases his present recollections on what he remembers
from his wanderings in the Bavarian capital prior
to the Second World War, since which time changes
without number may well have changed the picture.
But one thing is reasonably certain&mdash;if the old house
at Altheimer Eck (Number 2) still stands it continues
to have affixed to its wall the decorative inscription:
&ldquo;Am 11 Juni 1864 wurde hier Richard Strauss
geboren.&rdquo; (&ldquo;On June 11, 1864, Richard Strauss was
born here.&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The Pschorrs apart from being excellent brewers
were excellent musicians. One of the four daughters,
Josephine, later Richard&rsquo;s mother, a fairly accomplished
pianist, taught her son piano in his fifth year.
A noted harpist, August Tombo, continued the lessons
and by the time the boy was seven he was administered
violin instruction. Franz Strauss, Richard&rsquo;s
father, was an individual of a fibre as tough as
Josephine Pschorr, who became his wife, was mild-mannered
and sensitive. But he was an amazingly
fine horn player, for the sake of whose virtuosity
and musicianship greater men than he put up with
his ill manners and incredible tantrums. A venomous
reactionary, his particular detestation was Wagner,
against whom he never hesitated to exhibit the meanest
traits of which he was capable. Even when the
author of <i>Tristan</i> expressed himself as overjoyed with
the sound of the orchestra at a first rehearsal of his
work in the little Residenz Theatre Franz Strauss
retorted: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true! It sounded like an old
tin kettle!&rdquo; He pronounced Wagner&rsquo;s horn parts
&ldquo;unplayable&rdquo; so that Wagner had to call upon Hans
Richter to try out for him some passages in <i>Die
Meistersinger</i> in order to demonstrate that they were
anything but &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. With the elder Strauss
Hans von B&uuml;low was repeatedly at loggerheads. And
when he once attempted to thank B&uuml;low for some
favor the latter had shown young Richard Strauss
B&uuml;low exploded with the words: &ldquo;You have no right
to thank me! I did your son a favor not on your
account but only because I consider his talent deserves
it!&rdquo; To the end of his days Franz Strauss remained a
cantankerous individual.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Young Richard may not have exhibited the precocity
of a Mozart or a Mendelssohn but there could
be no doubt that musical impulses stirred in the child.
He piled up a considerable quantity of juvenilia,
beginning as a six-year-old. In 1871 he turned out
a &ldquo;Schneiderpolka&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;Tailor&rsquo;s Polka&rdquo;. There followed
dance pieces for piano, &ldquo;wedding music&rdquo; for
keyboard and children&rsquo;s instruments, some marches
and more miscellany of the sort. It was related by his
naturally proud relations that the lad could write
notes even before he had learned the alphabet. There
would be no particular point in detailing these boyish
accomplishments, yet when Richard was twelve an
uncle paid for the publication by Breitkopf und H&auml;rtel
of a &ldquo;Festival March&rdquo;, which gained the distinction
of appearing as &ldquo;Opus 1&rdquo;. It need hardly be said that
he participated in domestic performances of chamber
music with regularity. All the same his school
work maintained a high level, even if it did not consume
a needless amount of time. He also found
leisure to jot in the pages of his mathematics copybook
whole passages of a violin concerto which
appears to have been set down during his classroom
lessons. According to his biographer, Willy Brandl, the
piece was written so rapidly that the student contrived
a three-line staff instead of the usual five-line
one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>At this period his musical tastes were colored by
those of his father. Thus there is no reason for surprise
that the compositions he turned out up to the
end of his high school days were the customary platitudes
of classical and romantic models. Especially
Schumann and Mendelssohn were rather colorlessly
reflected in the products the youth fashioned. Even
considering his father&rsquo;s poisonous detestation of
Wagner it still remains hard to grasp how weak was
the pressure the creator of <i>Tristan</i> and <i>Meistersinger</i>
exercised on the son precisely when the Wagnerian
idiom was beginning to permeate the language of music.
More than that, it took time for the boy Strauss to rid
his system of the ludicrous prejudices he parroted for a
while. To his friend the composer, Ludwig Thuille,
he confided that <i>Lohengrin</i> (which he heard at fifteen)
was &ldquo;sweet and sickly, in all but the action&rdquo;; and after
his first exposure to <i>Siegfried</i> he lamented that he was
&ldquo;more cruelly bored than I can tell!&rdquo; Then he concluded
with this burst of prophecy: &ldquo;You can be
assured that in ten years nobody will remember who
Richard Wagner was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Strauss was to outlive such heresies by the
sensible process of steeping himself in Wagner&rsquo;s
scores rather than by viewing inadequate performances
as truths of Holy Writ. It is hardly necessary to emphasize
the dismay of Franz Strauss as, little by little, he
became aware of the turn things were taking. He
who had striven to bring up his son in his own Philistine
ways was gradually brought face to face with
the upsetting fact that the young man might be getting
out of hand! Richard was no music school or
conservatory pupil, and had presumably none too
many academic precepts to unlearn. One advantage
of this was that nothing tempted him to cut short
other phases of his education; and in the autumn of
1882 he began to attend philosophical, literary and
other cultural lectures at the University of Munich, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
that there were no serious gaps in his schooling. He
continued to compose industriously (a chorus in the
<i>Elektra</i> of Sophocles was one of his creations in this
period); but in after years he warned against &ldquo;rushing
before the public with unripe efforts.&rdquo; Subsequently
he visited upon the works of his salad days this judgment:
&ldquo;In them I lost much real freshness and force.&rdquo;
So much for those who question even today the soundness
of this early verdict.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>One advantage he came early to enjoy&mdash;the good
will of Hermann Levi, the Munich conductor (or,
let us give him his more imposing official title of
&ldquo;Generalmusikdirektor&rdquo;) who first presided in Bayreuth
over Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Parsifal</i>. In 1881 the outstanding
chamber music organization of the Bavarian capital
performed a string quartet of young Strauss and
very shortly afterwards Levi sponsored the first public
hearing of a rather more ambitious effort, a symphony
in D minor. Before a capacity audience the noted conductor
went so far as to congratulate the high school
student. It should be set down to the credit of the
scarcely seventeen-year-old composer that he did not
for a moment suffer the tribute to turn his head. Next
morning the student was back in his classroom, as
unconcerned with his triumphs of the preceding evening
as if they had all been no more than an agreeable
dream. The usually peppery father appears to
have been somewhat less balanced than his son and
a little earlier took it upon himself to dispatch
Richard&rsquo;s <i>Serenade for Wind Instruments</i>, Opus 7,
to Hans von B&uuml;low. &ldquo;Not a genius, but at the most
a talent of the kind that grows on every bush,&rdquo; shot
back the latter after a glimpse at the score of this
adolescent production. But B&uuml;low&rsquo;s irritable mood
softened before long and he was considerably more
flattering about other of the composer&rsquo;s works which
came to his attention. All the same B&uuml;low grew to
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
like the <i>Serenade</i> well enough to make room for it
on one of his programs. Meantime&mdash;on November
27, 1882&mdash;Franz W&uuml;llner produced it in Dresden.
And it was a strange quirk of fate which made
of this piece the unexpected vehicle for Richard&rsquo;s first
exploit as a conductor! It so happened that B&uuml;low
eventually scheduled it (1884) for one of his concerts.
At the eleventh hour the older musician, suffering
from an indisposition, appealed to his young friend
to direct his own work. Trusting to luck Richard
suffered a baton to be thrust into his hands, and
almost in a dream state, hardly knowing how things
would turn out, piloted the players through the score.
&ldquo;All that I realize,&rdquo; he afterwards said, &ldquo;is that I did
not break down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Strauss was not idling. The products of his
energetic young manhood if they do not bulk large
in his exploits indicate clearly how carefully he was
striving to learn his craft without, at the same time,
seeking to blaze trails. One finds him turning out in
1881 five piano pieces as well as the string quartet
just mentioned; a piano sonata, a sonata for cello and
piano, a concerto for violin and orchestra, <i>Mood Pictures</i>
for piano, a concerto for horn and orchestra,
and a symphony in F minor. This symphony, incidentally,
was first produced by Theodore Thomas,
on December 13, 1884, at a concert of the New York
Philharmonic Society. Perhaps more important, however,
were the songs Strauss was writing at this stage.
For they have preserved a vitality which Strauss&rsquo;s
instrumental products of that early period have long
since lost. It is not easy to grasp at this date that it
was the early Strauss the world has to thank for such
masterpieces of song literature as the incorrigibly
popular (one might almost say hackneyed), <i>Lieder</i>
as &ldquo;Zueignung&rdquo;, &ldquo;Die Nacht&rdquo;, &ldquo;Die Georgine&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Geduld&rdquo;, &ldquo;Allerseelen&rdquo;, &ldquo;St&auml;ndchen&rdquo;, and a number
of other such lyric specimens, many of them in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
truest tradition of the German art song. Indeed, the
boldness, the diversity, declamatory, rhythmic and
melodic features of Strauss&rsquo;s achievements in this field
might almost be said to have preceded the more sensational
aspects of his orchestral works.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The songs of Strauss, the earliest specimens of
which date from 1882, and which span (though in
steadily diminishing numbers), the most fruitful years
of his life, aggregate something like 150. If the better
known ones are with piano accompaniment, not a
few are scored for an orchestral one. A large
number long ago became musical household words,
along with the <i>Lieder</i> of Schubert, Schumann and
Brahms, though having a physiognomy quite their
own. The woman who became his wife, Pauline de
Ahna, was an accomplished vocalist and that circumstance
goes far to account for the diversity of his
efforts in this province. The joint recitals of the pair
stimulated for a considerable period the composer&rsquo;s
lyric imagination. If his inspiration eventually sought
expression in larger frames it must be noted that the
slant of his genius habitually ran to larger conceptions.
In any event the <i>Lieder Abende</i> of Strauss and
his betrothed help explain the creative impulses which
at this stage found so much of their outlet in song-writing.
The composer was later to explain that a new
song might be dashed off at any half-way idle moment&mdash;might
even be scribbled down in the twinkling of
an eye between the acts of an opera performance or
during a concert intermission. And as spontaneously
as Schubert, Richard Strauss busied himself with
poems of the most varied character.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>On the young man&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday Hans
von B&uuml;low recommended to Duke George of Meiningen
&ldquo;an uncommonly gifted&rdquo; musician as substitute
while he himself went on a journey for his shattered
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
health. B&uuml;low referred to the suggested deputy
as &ldquo;Richard III&rdquo;, since after Richard Wagner, &ldquo;there
could be no Richard II.&rdquo; Strauss arrived in Meiningen
in October, 1885. The little ducal capital boasted a
high artistic standing. Its theatrical company enjoyed
international fame. The town, to be sure, had no
opera, but the orchestra, though numbering only
48 instrumentalists, had been so trained by the suffering
yet exigent B&uuml;low that it was virtually unrivalled
in Germany. The newcomer was encouraged
to submit under his mentor&rsquo;s eye to an intensive training.
B&uuml;low&rsquo;s rehearsals ran from nine in the morning
till one in the afternoon and his disciple from Munich
was invariably on hand from the first to the last
note. The rest of the day was devoted to score reading
and to every subtlety of conductor&rsquo;s technic. The
young man was absolutely overwhelmed by &ldquo;the
exhaustive manner in which B&uuml;low sought out the
ultimate poetic content of the scores of Beethoven
and Wagner.&rdquo; And a favorite saying of the older
musician was never to be forgotten by his disciple from
Munich: &ldquo;First learn to read the score of a Beethoven
symphony with absolute correctness, and you will
already have its interpretation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Strauss made other friends and valuable connections
in Meiningen. One of the most important and influential
of these was an impassioned devotee of Wagner,
Alexander Ritter. Like so many apostles of the creator
of <i>Parsifal</i> at that period, Ritter was a violent opponent
of Brahms. Besides he was the composer of a
comic opera, &ldquo;Der faule Hans&rdquo;, and of a symphonic
poem that once enjoyed a vogue in Germany, &ldquo;Kaiser
Rudolfs Ritt zum Grabe&rdquo;. It was Ritter&rsquo;s service to
familiarize Strauss with some of the deepest secrets of
the scores and writings of Wagner as well as of Liszt,
and he understood how to fire his young friend with
soaring enthusiasm for his own ideals. He also did
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
much to inspire the budding conductor with a taste
for the writings of Schopenhauer, an inclination he
himself had inherited from Wagner. Ritter&rsquo;s influence,
in short, was one of the luckiest developments at this
stage of Strauss&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>The first concert the youth from Munich conducted
in Meiningen took place on October 18, 1885. It
afforded him a chance to exploit his talents as pianist
and batonist as well as composer, what with a program
that included Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Coriolanus</i> Overture
and Seventh Symphony, Mozart&rsquo;s C minor Piano
Concerto and that F minor Symphony of his own
which Theodore Thomas had conducted the previous
year in New York. Strauss had every reason to be
pleased with the outcome. B&uuml;low speaking of his debut
as pianist and conductor had referred to it as &ldquo;geradezu
verbl&uuml;ffend&rdquo; (&ldquo;simply stunning&rdquo;); even the
hard-shelled Brahms, who chanced to be on hand,
had deigned to encourage him with a cordial &ldquo;very
nice, young man!&rdquo; When on December 1 of that year
B&uuml;low gave up the orchestra&rsquo;s leadership, Strauss
inherited the post, conducted all concerts and had to
direct, sometimes on the spur of the moment, almost
anything this or that high placed personage might
suddenly take a fancy to hear. With the courage of
despair he repeatedly attempted compositions he
hardly knew or had not directed publicly. Yet he
never made a botch of the job, inwardly as he may
have quaked.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>To this period belongs a composition which has survived
and at intervals turns up on our symphonic programs&mdash;the
curious <i>Burleske</i> for piano and orchestra.
The piece is something of a problem but it is one
of the most yeasty and original products of its composer&rsquo;s
youth. It possesses a type of wit and bold
humor worthy of the subsequent author of <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i>.
If it still betrays Brahmsian influences some
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of those dialogues between piano and kettledrums
depart sharply from the more flabby romantic effusions
of the youth who still clung to the coat tails of
Schumann, Mendelssohn and some lesser romantics.
Rightly or wrongly the composer always harbored a
dislike for the <i>Burleske</i> though when he created it
his original instinct led him aright, if more or less
unconsciously. Not till four years later did the pianist,
Eugen d&rsquo;Albert, give it a public hearing in Eisenach;
at that, Strauss himself never brought himself to
dignify the <i>Burleske</i> with an opus number and insisted
he would not have consented to its publication but
for his need of funds. Today the saucy little score
seems more alive than certain other early efforts
which were rather closer to their composer&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Meiningen had been a sort of stepping stone.
Strongly against the advice of Hans von B&uuml;low, who
detested Munich from the depths of his being, Strauss,
nevertheless, accepted a conductor&rsquo;s post in his native
city, where he had the advantage of continuing his
stimulating contact with Alexander Ritter, who had
followed him to the Bavarian capital. Yet he did not
look forward to a Munich position with particular
joy. Before entering on his duties he permitted himself
a vacation in Naples and Sorrento. In Munich he
found the Royal Court Theatre bogged down in a
morass of routine. The musical direction of that establishment,
though in the capable hands of Hermann
Levi, was unfired by real enthusiasm, let alone true
inspiration. The first of Strauss&rsquo;s official assignments
was the direction of Boieldieu&rsquo;s op&eacute;ra comique, <i>Jean
de Paris</i>, and a quantity of similar old and harmless
pieces. One promised duty which augured well was
a production of Wagner&rsquo;s boyhood opera, <i>Die Feen</i>.
He would probably never have been promised anything
so rewarding had not the conductor for whom
it had been intended in the first place fallen ill. But
even this unusual prize was in the end snatched from
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
his grasp after he had presided over the rehearsals.
At the last moment the direction of the Wagner curio
was assigned to a certain Fischer. There was a managerial
conference concerning the matter at which,
we are told, &ldquo;Strauss was like a lioness defending
her young&rdquo;; but the Intendant put a stop to the argument
by announcing that &ldquo;he disliked conducting in
the B&uuml;low style&rdquo; and that, moreover, Strauss was
becoming intolerable because of his high pretensions
&ldquo;for one of his youth and lack of experience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the composer made the most of leisure
he did not really want, by occupying himself with
more or less creative work. One of his editorial feats
of this period was a new stage version of Gluck&rsquo;s
<i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i>, manifestly inspired by Wagner&rsquo;s
treatment of the same master&rsquo;s <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en
Aulide</i>. More important still was his first really large-scale
work, <i>Aus Italien</i>, to which he gave the subtitle
<i>Symphonic Fantasy for large Orchestra</i>. He
had completed the score in 1886 and on March 2,
1887, he conducted it at the Munich Odeon. To his
uncle Horburger he wrote an amusing account of the
first performance at which, it appears, moderate
applause followed the first three movements and violent
hissing competed with handclappings. &ldquo;There
has been much ado here over the performance of
my <i>Fantasy</i>&rdquo; Strauss wrote his uncle &ldquo;and general
amazement and wrath because I, too, have begun
to go my own way.&rdquo; And his biographer, Max
Steinitzer, told that the composer&rsquo;s father, outraged
by the hisses, hurried to the artist&rsquo;s room to see his
son and found him, far from disturbed, sitting on a
table dangling his legs! One detail the composer of
this symphonic Italian excursion failed to notice&mdash;namely
that in utilizing the tune <i>Funiculi, Funicula</i>
for the movement depicting the colorful life of Naples
he was quoting, not as he fancied a genuine Neapolitan
folksong, but an only too familiar tune by Luigi
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Denza, who lived much of his life in a London suburb!</p>
<p>Be all this as it may, Strauss had more to occupy
his thoughts than the fortunes of his Italian impressions
to which he had given musical shape. In 1886-87
he composed (besides a sonata in E flat for violin
and piano and a number of fine <i>Lieder</i>&mdash;among
them the lovely and uplifting &ldquo;Breit &uuml;ber mein
Haupt&rdquo;) the tone poem, <i>Macbeth</i> (least known of
them all). He revised it in 1890 and on October 13
of that year conducted it in Weimar. But <i>Macbeth</i>
has been completely overshadowed by the next tone
poem (of earlier opus number but later composition),
the glowing, romantic, vibrant <i>Don Juan</i>
which has a spontaneity and an indestructible
freshness that give it a kind of electrical vitality
none of the orchestral works of their composer&rsquo;s
early manhood quite rival, unless we except that masterpiece
of humor, <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i>&mdash;itself a different
proposition. It had been the powerful impressions
made on the composer by some of the
Shakespearian productions of the dramatic company
in Meiningen which gave the incentive for <i>Macbeth</i>.
In the case of <i>Don Juan</i> the moving impulse was the
poem of Nikolaus Lenau (whose real name was
Niembsch von Strahlenau), and who described the
hero of his work as &ldquo;one longing to find one who
represented incarnate womanhood&rdquo; in whom he could
enjoy &ldquo;all the women on earth whom he cannot as
individuals possess.&rdquo; Unable in the nature of things
to achieve this tall order Lenau&rsquo;s <i>Don Juan</i> falls prey
to &ldquo;Disgust, and this Disgust is the devil that fetches
him.&rdquo; Strauss gave no definite meanings to specific
phases of his music, though he was not to want for
interpreters and one of them, Wilhelm Mauke, found
it preferable to discard the model supplied by Lenau
and to discover in the tone poem the various women
who inhabit Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Don Giovanni</i>. Be this as it may,
the score delighted the first hearers when it was played
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
in Weimar; they tried to have it repeated on the spot.
Hans von B&uuml;low wrote that his prot&eacute;g&eacute; had, with
<i>Don Juan</i> had an &ldquo;almost unheard-of success&rdquo;; and
the young composer might well have seen a good
augury in the notorious Eduard Hanslick&rsquo;s outcries
to the effect that the score was chiefly a &ldquo;tumult of
dazzling color daubs&rdquo; and in his shrieks that Strauss
&ldquo;had a great talent for false music, for the musically
ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot be said that he was truly happy with his
Munich experiences and the disappointments which,
if the truth were known, seemed for the moment to
dog his footsteps. He was, to be sure, adding to his
accomplishments as a composer and plans for an
opera began to stir in him. Moreover, he had more
and more chances to accept guest engagements as a
conductor and such opportunities were taking him on
more and more tours in Germany. He had striven
to do his best in the city of his birth yet few seemed
to be grateful for his efforts to clean up drab accumulations
of routine. B&uuml;low realized from long
and heart-breaking experience what his friend was
undergoing. Very few thanked the idealist for his
efforts to better the musical standing of his home town.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>At what might be described as a truly psychological
moment of his career Strauss was approached
by B&uuml;low&rsquo;s old friend, the former Liszt pupil, Hans
von Bronsart, with an invitation to transfer his activities
to Weimar. He had every reason to look with
favor on the project. Weimar was hallowed in his
eyes by its earlier literary and musical associations.
It had harbored Goethe and Schiller and been sanctified
in the young musician&rsquo;s sight by the labors of
Liszt. His Munich friend, the tenor Heinrich Zeller,
who had coached Wagner roles with him, had
settled there, and a young soprano, Pauline de Ahna,
the daughter of a Bavarian general with strong musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
enthusiasms, soon followed him. In proper course
she was to become Richard Strauss&rsquo;s wife. A high-spirited,
outspoken lady, never disposed to mince
words, a source of innumerable yarns and witticisms,
and who saw to it that her celebrated husband carefully
toed the mark, Pauline Strauss was in every
way a chapter by herself. And when, not very long
after his death she followed him to the grave it seemed
only a benign provision of fate that she should not
too long survive him.</p>
<p>Strauss almost instantly infused a new blood into
the artistic life of Weimar, where he settled in 1889
and remained till 1894. The worthy old court Kapellmeister,
Eduard Lassen, was sensible enough to allow
his energetic new associate complete freedom of
action. True, the artistic means at his disposal were
relatively modest and at first they might well have
given the ambitious newcomer pause. The orchestra
then contained only six first violins; there was a painfully
superannuated little chorus and most of the
leading singers had seen better days. But the conductor
from Munich was disturbed by none of these
apparent handicaps. In Bayreuth he had already
learned the proper way of producing Wagner, and even
when the means were limited, he tolerated no concessions;
all Wagnerian performances had to be done
without cuts or at least with a minimum of curtailments.
A wisecrack began to go the rounds: &ldquo;What
is Richard Strauss doing?&rdquo; to which the reply was:
&ldquo;Strauss is opening cuts!&rdquo; The moldy old settings
were replaced by new ones and once when there were
insufficient funds to buy new stage appointments
Strauss approached the Grand Duke with a plea that
he might lay out of his own pocket a thousand Marks
to freshen the settings. To the credit of the ruler it
should be told that he refused the offer and disbursed
the sum himself. But Strauss&rsquo;s reforms were
far from ending there. He once confessed that in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
comprehensive job he was not only conductor but
&ldquo;coach, scene painter, stage manager and tailor&rdquo;&mdash;in
short, a thoroughgoing Pooh-Bah. He threw himself
heart and soul into the job, so much so that in
spite of a small stage and limited means he produced,
in the presence of none other than Cosima Wagner
a <i>Lohengrin</i> that deeply gripped her.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>He had symphonic concerts as well as operas to
occupy him. At one of the former he transported
his hearers with the world premiere of his <i>Don Juan</i>.
The date deserves to be noted&mdash;November 11, 1889.
That same year he had composed another tone
poem, <i>Death and Transfiguration</i>, and on June 21,
1889, he permitted an audience in nearby Eisenach
to hear it. The work is program music, if you will;
but the idea that it originally set out to illustrate the
poem about the man dying in a &ldquo;necessitous little
room&rdquo; and, after his death struggles, translated to
supernal glories, is wrong. Moreover the long accepted
notion, that the music is based on lines by Alexander
Ritter, is fallacious. For, in the first place the
composer did not aim to illustrate his friend&rsquo;s word
picture; and in the second, Ritter wrote the poem
only <i>after</i> becoming acquainted with the score. This
is what explains a certain incongruity between Ritter&rsquo;s
verses and the tones which, in reality were never conceived
in slavish illustration of them. Hanslick, wrong
as usual, was to write misleadingly: &ldquo;Once again a
previously printed poem makes it certain that the
listener cannot go awry; for the music follows this
poetic program step by step, quite as in a ballet
scenario.&rdquo; And he spoke of the score as a gruesome
combat of dissonances in which the wood-wind howls
in runs of chromatic thirds while the brass growls and
all the strings rage!</p>
<p>By this time accustomed to such critical nonsense
the composer did not suffer himself to be troubled.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
What disturbed him much more was that his old
champion, von B&uuml;low, gave indications of no longer
seeing eye to eye with him. At B&uuml;low&rsquo;s suggestion
Strauss had revised and newly instrumented <i>Macbeth</i>
but the piece was to continue a stepchild. Soon he was
increasing his output of songs and enriching Liedersingers
with such treasures as &ldquo;Ruhe, meine Seele&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Caecilie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Heimliche Aufforderung&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morgen&rdquo;;
while only a few short years ahead lay &ldquo;Traum durch
die D&auml;mmerung&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nachtgesang&rdquo; and &ldquo;Schlagende
Herzen&rdquo;, to delight nearly two generations of
recitalists.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Strauss had always been blessed with a robust
health. Unlike Wagner, for instance, he never suffered
from exacerbated nerves and violent extremes of
unbalanced mood. But at the period of which we
speak he did experience one of his rare periods of
illness. What between his guest engagements, his
rehearsals, the strain of composing, attending to
details of publication and myriad other obligations
of a traveling conductor and virtuoso, he came down
in May, 1891, with a menacing grippe which sent
him to bed and threatened serious complications.
He was resigned to anything, even if he did confess:
&ldquo;Dying would not be in itself so bad, but first
I should like to be able to conduct <i>Tristan</i>!&rdquo; He
recovered and had his wish in 1892. But in the summer
he was sick once more, this time with pneumonia.
Now it looked as if one lung were seriously threatened.
He was granted the vacation he requested, from November,
1892, to July of the succeeding year. Taking
some works and sketches he started, on the advice of
his physicians, for the south.</p>
<p>The convalescent, with a finished opera libretto
in his baggage went to repair his health in Italy,
Greece and Egypt. In Egypt he recovered completely.
In the Anhalter railway station, Berlin, he was to see
for the last time the mortally sick von B&uuml;low, likewise
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
journeying to Egypt in a last effort to repair
his shattered constitution. Poor B&uuml;low was not to
survive the trip. The wiry frame of Strauss helped
him over any threat of tuberculosis and not only defied
any peril to his lungs but seemed actually to renew
his creative powers. The libretto which occupied his
attention was that of his opera, <i>Guntram</i>, the first
and least known of his productions for the lyric stage.</p>
<p><i>Guntram</i> is without question a &ldquo;Stiefkind&rdquo; among
Richard Strauss&rsquo;s operas. The average Strauss enthusiast&rsquo;s
acquaintance with its music may be said to be
confined to the brief phrase from it cited in the section
called <i>The Hero&rsquo;s Works of Peace</i> in the tone
poem <i>Ein Heldenleben</i>. Nevertheless, the opera cost
the composer six long years of his time. It received a
performance in Weimar, July 12, 1894. On October
29, 1940, it was to be heard again, and once more in
Weimar. Strauss tells in his little volume, <i>Betrachtungen
und Erinnerungen</i>, that it had &ldquo;no more than a
<i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i> and that its failure to gain a foothold
anywhere (even with generous cuts) took from him
all courage to write operas.&rdquo; Efforts were made late
in its creator&rsquo;s life to revive it, all of them as good
as futile. As recently as June 13, 1942, the Berlin State
Opera tried, with the help of the conductor, Robert
Heger, to pump life into it. Strauss found not a little
of the opera &ldquo;still vital&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>lebensf&auml;hig</i>&rdquo;) and felt sure it
would produce a fine effect given a large orchestra.
He liked particularly in his old age the second half
of the second act and the whole of the third. The
book has been described as revealing the influence
of Wagner. Guntram, a member of a religious order
in the time of the Minnesingers, esteems the ruling
duke, but kills himself, after renouncing the duchess,
the object of his affection. Despite the dramatic resemblances
to <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i> Alexander
Ritter found in the opera a departure from Wagnerian
influences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Slowly as Strauss labored over the three acts of
<i>Guntram</i> he spent no such time on the tone poems
which now began to follow in rapid succession. After
the ill-fated opera and a quantity of fine new <i>Lieder</i>,
superbly diversified in expressive scope and lyric
moods, there followed the tone poem which, apart
from <i>Don Juan</i> continues even in the present age to
address itself most warmly to the public heart&mdash;<i>Till
Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s Merry Pranks</i>. Analysts of one sort
and another have provided the work with a program,
which has long been accepted as standard. The
composer himself declined to supply one, maintaining
that the listener himself should seek to &ldquo;crack the
hard nut Till, the folk rogue of ancient tradition&rdquo;
had supplied his public. He himself would say nothing
to clear up the secrets of the lovable knave, who
came to his merited end on the gallows. If Strauss confided
to his public the nature of many of Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s
various ribaldries and madcap adventures he might,
he maintained, easily cause offense. Concertgoers
could cudgel their brains all they chose, Richard
Strauss would keep his own counsel! Naturally,
his work acquired, rightly or wrongly, regiments
of &ldquo;interpreters&rdquo;. If &ldquo;nasty, noisome, rollicking
Till, with the whirligig scale of a yellow clarinet in
his brain,&rdquo; as the worthy William J. Henderson eventually
described him, the irrepressible &ldquo;Volksnarr&rdquo;
was ultimately to become visualized as a kind of medieval
ballet fable sporting all the benefits of story-book
scenery and dramatic action. The result actually was
not too remote from what Strauss originally intended.
Its popular musical elements, such as the fetching
polka tune (or &ldquo;Gassenhauer&rdquo;), the use of the folk
melody (&ldquo;Ich hatt&rsquo; einen Kamaraden&rdquo;) and a good
deal else seemed theatrically conceived. The use of
the Rondeau form was ideally suited to the idea which
the composer strove to formulate. At one period
Strauss, conscious of the operatic elements of <i>Till</i>, was
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
moved to give the work a thoroughgoing dramatic
setting and began to sketch the piece as a sort of lyric
drama, or rather a scherzo with staging and action.
But he lost interest in the scheme and did not progress
beyond plans for a first act. Franz W&uuml;llner conducted
the premiere of <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i> in Cologne, November
5, 1895.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It has been pointed out that if the masculine element
is idealized in Strauss&rsquo;s tone poems it is rather
the feminine which he gives precedence in his operas.
Something of an exception to this is exemplified in
the next purely orchestral work, the tone poem <i>Thus
Spake Zarathustra</i>, which followed less than a year
later and was produced under its composer&rsquo;s direction
at one of the Museum concerts in Frankfurt-on-the-Main,
November 27, 1896. The score is described
as &ldquo;freely after Nietzsche&rdquo;. At once there arose
protests that Strauss had tried to set Nietzschean philosophy
to music! Actually he had aimed to do no
such preposterous thing, and <i>Zarathustra</i> posed no
genuine problems. If the score is the weaker for
some of its syrupy and sentimental pages it includes
another, such as the magnificent sunrise picture
at the beginning, which can only be placed for
overpowering effect beside the passage &ldquo;Let there be
Light and there was Light&rdquo; in Haydn&rsquo;s <i>Creation</i>. If
ever anything could testify to Strauss&rsquo;s incontestable
genius it is this grandiose page! Other portions, it
may be conceded, lapse into commonplace, but the
close in two keys at once (B and C) offered one of
the early examples of polytonality that duly outraged
the timid. Today this clash of tonalities has
quite lost its power to frighten. In 1898 and for
quite some time thereafter, it passed for hardly less
than an invention of Satan! Strauss intended this juxtaposition
to characterize &ldquo;two conflicting worlds of
ideas&rdquo;. Possibly it can be made to sound sharply dissonant
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
on the piano; the magic of Strauss&rsquo;s orchestration,
however, eliminates all suggestion of crude
cacophony.</p>
<p>On March 18, 1898, Cologne heard under the
baton of Franz W&uuml;llner, a work of rather different
order, <i>Don Quixote</i>, Fantastic Variations on a Theme
of Knightly Character. It is a set of orchestral variations
on two themes, the one heard in the solo cello
and characterizing the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,
the second (solo viola) picturing his squire,
Sancho Panza. As a feat of individualizing these variations
are a thing apart. The tone painting is unrivalled
in its composer&rsquo;s achievements up to that time. A
number of special effects, which long invited attention
over and above their real musical worth called
forth considerably more astonishment than they really
deserved. The pitiful bleatings of a flock of sheep,
violently scattered by the lance of the crack-brained
Don, his attacks on a company of itinerant monks,
his ride through the air (amid the whistlings of a
&ldquo;wind machine&rdquo;)&mdash;these and other effects of the
sort are actually only minor phases of the score. Its
memorable qualities, aside from striking pictorial conceits,
are rather to be found in the moving and tender
pages portraying the passing of Don Quixote as the
mists clear from his poor addled brain. There are
episodes of a melting tenderness in these which rank
among the most eloquent utterances Strauss has
attained.</p>
<p>Still another tone poem was to succeed&mdash;<i>A Hero&rsquo;s
Life</i> (<i>Ein Heldenleben</i>) performed under the composer&rsquo;s
direction in Frankfurt. The work is autobiographical
with the composer himself as its hero and
his helpmate, (obviously Frau Pauline, his &ldquo;better
half&rdquo; as she was to be called). For a long time <i>Ein
Heldenleben</i> passed as the prize horror among
Strauss&rsquo;s creations, especially its fierce and rambunctious
battle scene, which some critics considered a
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
kind of bugaboo with which to frighten the wits out
of grown-up concertgoers! For its day <i>A Hero&rsquo;s Life</i>
was unquestionably strong meat. If people were horrified
by the racket and cacophony of the battle scene
they were no less disposed to irritation at the cackling
sounds with which Strauss pilloried his benighted
foes who resented his aims and accomplishments. And
they were displeased by the immodesty with which
he exhibited himself as a real and misprized hero by
the citation of fragments from his own works. Some,
among them as staunch a Strauss admirer as Romain
Rolland, were disturbed not because the composer
talked in his works &ldquo;about himself&rdquo; but &ldquo;because of
the way in which he talked about himself.&rdquo; All the
same Strauss was to boast no truer champion throughout
his career than the sympathetic and keenly understanding
author of <i>Jean-Christophe</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ein Heldenleben</i> was the last but one of the series
of tone poems which were to lead to a new phase of
Richard Strauss&rsquo;s career. The last of this series, the
<i>Symphonia Domestica</i>, was completed in Charlottenburg,
Berlin, on December 31, 1903. Its first public
hearing took place under the composer&rsquo;s direction in
Carnegie Hall, New York, March 21, 1904. The
<i>Domestic Symphony</i>, &ldquo;dedicated to my dear wife
and our boy&rdquo; is in &ldquo;one movement and three subdivisions.
After an introduction and scherzo there follow
without break an <i>Adagio</i>, then a tumultuous double
fugue and finale.&rdquo; The reviewers discovered all manner
of programmatic connotations in this depiction
of a day in Strauss&rsquo;s family life though he was eventually
to tell a New York reviewer that he &ldquo;wanted
the work to be taken as music&rdquo; pure and simple and
not as an elaboration of a specific program. He maintained
his belief &ldquo;that the anxious search on the part
of the public for the exactly corresponding passages
in the music and the program, the guessing as to significance
of this or that, the distraction of following
a train of thought exterior to the music are destructive
to the musical enjoyment.&rdquo; And he forbade the
publication of what he sought to express till after the
concert.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>He might as well have saved himself the trouble!
There is no room here to point out even a small fraction
of what the critics heard in the work, encouraged
by a casual note or two the conductor found it necessary
to set down at certain stages of the score. The
youngster&rsquo;s aunts are supposed to remark that the
infant is &ldquo;just like his father&rdquo;, the uncles &ldquo;just like
his mother&rdquo;. A glockenspiel announces that the
time, at one point is seven in the morning. The
child gets his bath and the ablutions are accompanied
by shrieks and squeals. Husband and wife
discuss the future of the baby and there is a lively
domestic argument which ends happily. Ernest Newman,
irritated like numerous other reviewers by the
torrents of vain talk the piece called forth, was to
complain that &ldquo;Strauss behaved as foolishly over the
<i>Domestica</i> as he might have been expected to do after
his previous exploits in the same line&rdquo;...</p>
<p>The first organization to perform the work was the
orchestra of Hermann Hans Wetzler, in New York,
and it took several months longer for the music to
reach Germany. Mr. Newman had found the texture
of the whole is &ldquo;less interesting than in any
other of Strauss&rsquo;s works; the short and snappy thematic
fragments out of which the composer builds contrasting
badly with the great sweeping themes of the
earlier symphonic poems ... the realistic effects in
the score are at once so atrociously ugly and so
pitiably foolish that one listens to them with regret
that a composer of genius should ever have fallen
so low.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>More than a decade was to elapse before Strauss
was to concern himself again with problems of symphonic
music. Opera and ballet were to be the chief
business of those activities which one may look upon
as the middle period of his creative life. One may be
permitted a short backward glance to account for
some of his previous creations. Songs (a number of
the best of them), an &ldquo;Enoch Arden&rdquo; setting (declamation
with piano accompaniment) occupy the late
years of the 19th Century and the dawn of the 20th,
not to mention the choral ballad for mixed chorus
and orchestra <i>Taillefer</i>. More important, however, is
a second operatic venture. This opera in one act,
called <i>Feuersnot</i>, is a setting of a text by the noted
Ernst von Wolzogen, who was associated with the vogue
of the so-called &ldquo;Ueberbrettl&rdquo;, a sort of up-to-date
vaudeville, an &ldquo;arty&rdquo; movement typical of the period.
<i>Feuersnot</i> is a picture of a &ldquo;fire famine&rdquo; brought about
by an irate sorcerer in revenge for the act of a
maiden who scorned his love. Thereby all the fires of
the town are extinguished! The piece is rather too
long for a short opera and too short for a full-length
one. But the text is rich in word play, punning satire,
double meanings and topical allusions, interlarded
with biting reflections on the manner in which Munich
had once turned against Wagner and on the trouble
the benighted burghers would have in similarly ridding
themselves of the troublesome Strauss! There is not a
little of the real Strauss in the music, though at that,
less than one might expect from the composer of <i>Till
Eulenspiegel</i> and <i>Ein Heldenleben</i> which already lay
some distance in the past. <i>Feuersnot</i> was first staged at
the Dresden Opera on November 21, 1901, under the
leadership of Ernst von Schuch. And the consequence
was that for years to come Strauss&rsquo;s operatic premieres
took place in that gracious city.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>We now come into view of a milestone of modern
music drama. In 1902 Strauss attended a performance
of Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s play, &ldquo;Salome&rdquo;, at Max Reinhardt&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Kleines Theater in Berlin. Gertrude Eysoldt had the
title role. The Swiss musicologist, Willy Schuh, relates
that the composer, after the performance was accosted
by his friend, Heinrich Gr&uuml;nfeld, who remarked:
&ldquo;Strauss, this would be an operatic subject for you!&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am already composing it,&rdquo; was the reply. And the
composer went on to tell: &ldquo;The Viennese writer,
Anton Lindner, had already sent me the play and
offered to make an opera text of it for me. Upon my
agreement he sent me some cleverly versified opening
scenes which did not, however, inspire me with an
urge to composition; till one day the question shaped
itself in my mind: &lsquo;Why do I not compose at once,
without further preliminaries: Wie sch&ouml;n ist die Prinzessin
Salome heute Nacht!&rsquo; From then on it was not
difficult to cleanse the piece of &lsquo;literature&rsquo;, so that it
has become a thoroughly fine libretto!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity gave me a really exotic scheme of harmony,
which, showed itself especially in odd, heterogeneous
cadences having the effect of changeable silk.
It was the desire for the sharpest kind of individual
characterization that led me to bitonality. One can
look upon this as a solitary experiment as applied in
a special case but not recommend it for imitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Difficulties began with von Schuch&rsquo;s first piano rehearsals.
A number of singers sought to give back
their parts till Karl Burrian shamed them by answering,
when asked how he was progressing with the role
of Herod: &ldquo;I already know it by heart!&rdquo; A little later
the Salome, Frau Wittich, threatened to go on strike
because of the taxing part and the massive orchestra.
Soon, too, she began to rail against &ldquo;perversity and
impiety of the opera, refused to do this or that &lsquo;because
I am a decent woman&rsquo;,&rdquo; and drove the stage manager
almost frantic. Strauss remarked that her figure was
&lsquo;not really suited to the 16-year-old Princess with the
Isolde voice&rsquo; and complained that in subsequent performances
her dance and her actions with Jochanaan&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
head overstepped all bounds of propriety and taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Berlin, according to Strauss, the Kaiser would
permit the performance of the work, only after
Intendant von H&uuml;lsen had the idea of &ldquo;indicating at
the close by a sudden shining of the morning star the
coming of the Three Holy Kings.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
Wilhelm II remarked to H&uuml;lsen: &ldquo;I am sorry that
Strauss composed this <i>Salome</i>. I like him, but he is
going to do himself terrible harm with it!&rdquo; At the
dress rehearsal the famous high B flat of the double
basses so filled Count Seebach with the fear of an outbreak
of hilarity, that he prevailed upon the player of
the English horn to mitigate the effect, somewhat,
&ldquo;by means of a sustained B flat on that instrument.&rdquo;
Strauss&rsquo;s own father, hearing his son play a portion
of the opera on the piano, exclaimed a short time
before his death: &ldquo;My God, this nervous music! It is
as if beetles were crawling about in one&rsquo;s clothing!&rdquo;
And Cosima Wagner declared after listening to the
closing scene: &ldquo;This is madness!&rdquo; The clergy, too, was
up in arms and the first performance at the Vienna
State Opera in October, 1918, took place only after
an agitated exchange of letters with Archbishop Piffl.
The orchestra of <i>Salome</i> in all numbers 112 players.
Strauss, however eventually arranged the opera for
fewer players and Willy Schuh tells of the composer
having conducted it in Innsbruck with an orchestra of
only 56 players, winds in twos but highly efficient solo
instrumentalists.</p>
<p>At all events, Strauss has been described as an
inimitable conductor of <i>Salome</i>. Willy Schuh (whom
Strauss designated late in his life as his &ldquo;official&rdquo;
biographer, when the time came to prepare his
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; life story) alludes to Strauss as an &ldquo;allegro
composer&rdquo;, whose direction of <i>Salome</i> was of altogether
remarkable &ldquo;tranquillity&rdquo; and finds that the real
secret of his direction of this music drama was to be
sought in the &ldquo;restfulness&rdquo; and creative aspects of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
interpretation, &ldquo;which avoids every excess of whipped
up, overheated effects and sensationalism.&rdquo; It is, therefore,
illuminating to consider the modifications the
years have wrought on the interpretative treatment
proper to the work. Little by little the legend of the
decadent, hysterical, hyper-sensual work was replaced
by the assurance of its almost classical character; and
the truth of Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s declaration to Sarah Bernhardt
when the play was new: &ldquo;I aimed only to create
something curious and sensual&rdquo; has at length come to
the fore.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>There is scarcely any need to recount in any detail
the early difficulties of <i>Salome</i> in America, when the
scandalized cries that arose after the work received
a single representation at the Metropolitan Opera
House, in New York, only to be shelved as &ldquo;detrimental
to the best interests of the institution&rdquo; after
a solitary representation still ranks among the notorious
and less creditable legends of the American stage.
Strauss soon after this taste of the operations of
American puritanism accused Americans of &ldquo;hypocrisy,
the most loathsome of all vices.&rdquo; He was handsomely
avenged, however, when on January 28, 1909,
Oscar Hammerstein revived the work (with Mary
Garden as Salome) at his Manhattan Opera House
and started it on a triumphant American career,
which confounded all the ludicrous prognostications
and horrified shouts with which it has been greeted
only a short time earlier.</p>
<p>The work which followed <i>Salome</i> was <i>Elektra</i>, the
text of which was the creation of Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
Here began a collaboration between poet
and musician which was to last with fruitful results
until the latter&rsquo;s death, and to mark some of the high
points of Strauss&rsquo;s achievements. The story of their
joint labors is detailed in a priceless series of letters,
brought out in 1925 under the editorial supervision
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
of the composer&rsquo;s son, Dr. Franz Strauss. These letters
afford glimpses into the workshop of librettist and
composer which rank with some of the most illuminating
exchanges of the sort the history of music supplies.
From them we learn that before settling on the tragedy
of the house of Agamemnon the collaborators seriously
pondered as operatic material Calderon&rsquo;s <i>Daughter
of the Air</i> and also <i>Semiramis</i>. Then, early in 1908,
they seem to have agreed on <i>Elektra</i>. Hofmannsthal&rsquo;s
version of the Greek legend (based on Sophocles)
had been acted in Berlin (again with Gertrude Eysolt
in the title role); and no sooner had Strauss witnessed
the production than he concluded that the tragedy in
this form was virtually made to order for his music.</p>
<p>On July 6, 1908, the composer wrote to Hofmannsthal:
&ldquo;<i>Elektra</i> progresses and is going well; I hope
to hurry up the premiere for the end of January at
the latest.&rdquo; Strauss was as good as his word. The first
performance of <i>Elektra</i> took place January 25, 1909,
at the Dresden opera, Ernst von Schuch conducting,
with Anni Krull in the name part, Ernestine
Schumann-Heink as Klytemnestra and Carl Perron
as Orestes. If Strauss would have preferred to write
a comic opera after <i>Salome</i> the pull of the <i>genre</i> of
&ldquo;horror opera&rdquo; was still strong upon him and he was
not yet ready to loose himself from its grip. <i>Elektra</i>
was, if one chooses, gorier than <i>Salome</i> and perhaps
more genuinely psychopathic but less susceptible to
provocations of outraged morality. Its instrumental
requirements are rather larger than those of Strauss&rsquo;s
previous opera and the whole more nightmarish in
its sensational atmosphere. One had the impression,
however, that with <i>Elektra</i> the composer had reached
the end of a path. He could hardly repeat himself
with impunity along similar lines. A turn of the road
or something similar must come next unless Strauss&rsquo;s
achievements were to run up against a stone wall or
lead him into a blind alley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>This was not fated to happen. What the pair were
now to achieve was what was to prove their most
abiding triumph&mdash;<i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>, of all the
operas of Richard Strauss the most lastingly popular
and if not the indisputable best at all events the
most loved and, peradventure, the most viable&mdash;and,
if you will, the healthiest. If the piece is in some
respects sprawling and over-written it does contain a
piece of moving character-drawing which stands
with the most memorable things the literature of musical
drama affords. In her musical and dramatic lineaments
the aristocratic Marschallin, whose common
sense leads her, on the threshold of middle age to
renounce the calf love of the 17-year-old &ldquo;Rose
Bearer&rdquo;, Octavian, offers one of the finest and most
convincing figures to be found in modern opera&mdash;a
creation not unworthy to stand by the side of Wagner&rsquo;s
Hans Sachs. The Baron Ochs, an outright vulgarian,
if the music accorded him does not lie, is a figure who
might have stepped out of the pages of Rabelais;
Sophie, Faninal and all the rest of the characters who
enliven this canvas inhabited by almost photographic
types of 18th Century Vienna add up to a truly memorable
gallery with which Hofmannsthal and Strauss
have brought to life an era and a culture. Strauss&rsquo;s
score has indisputable prolixities and commonplaces.
But these traits may pass as defects of the opera&rsquo;s
qualities and, as such, they can take their place in
the vastly colorful pageant of Hofmannsthal&rsquo;s comedy
of manners.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that a
piece as earthy as <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> should pass without
provoking dissent. The German Kaiser, who had
small use for Strauss&rsquo;s operas, yielded to the urging
of the Crown Prince so far as to attend a performance,
then left the theatre with the words: &ldquo;Det is
keene Musik f&uuml;r mich!&rdquo; (&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no music for me!&rdquo;)
To spare the feelings of the straight-laced Kaiserin
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
it was arranged to place the Marschallin&rsquo;s bed in an
adjoining alcove instead of in high visibility on the
stage when the curtain rose. Nor were these the only
objections. And, of course, there were the usual exclamations
about the length of the piece, no end of
suggestions were advanced about the best ways to
shorten the work. Strauss, in protest against some of
the cuts von Schuch had practised in Dresden, once
insisted he had overlooked one of the most important
possible abbreviations! Why not omit the trio in the
last act, which only holds up the action! It should be
explained that the great trio is the brightest gem of
the act, perhaps, indeed, the lyric climax of the whole
score! As for the various waltzes which fill so many
pages of the third act (and to some degree of the
second) it may be admitted that, for all the skill of
their instrumentation they are by no means the highest
melodic flights of Strauss&rsquo;s fancy, some of them being
merely successions of rather trifling sequences.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It was assumed after <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> that the
success of the opera indicated that the composer, in
a mood for concessions, had tried to meet the public
half-way and had renounced the violence, the cacophonies
and the dissonances and sensational traits
supposed to be his stock-in-trade. The comedy was
assumed to be a proof of this. The real truth was that
Strauss had not changed his ideals and methods in
the least. It was, rather, <i>that the public, converted by
force of habit, was itself catching up with Strauss and
that the idiom of the composer was quickly becoming
the musical language of the hour</i>. Sometimes it took
even a few idiosyncrasies of the musician for granted.
One did not always inquire too closely into just
what he meant. There is one case when Strauss
even went to the length of <i>writing music</i> to the words
&ldquo;diskret, vertraulich&rdquo; (&ldquo;discreetly, confidentially&rdquo;)
when Hofmannsthal had written them as <i>stage
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
directions</i> to be followed <i>not</i> as part of a text to
be sung! All the same Strauss usually kept an eagle
eye on the dramatic action he composed. With regard
to the libretto of <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> he wrote to the
poet &ldquo;the first act is excellent, the second lacks certain
essential contrasts which it is impossible to put off
till the third. With only a feeble success for the second
act, the opera is doomed.&rdquo; Be this as it may, <i>Der
Rosenkavalier</i> was anything but &ldquo;doomed&rdquo;. It was, in
point of fact, the work which Strauss had in mind
when, at the close of the first <i>Elektra</i> performance
he remarked to some friends: &ldquo;Now I intend to write
a Mozart opera!&rdquo; Whether or not &ldquo;Der Rosenkavalier&rdquo;
really meets the prescriptions of a &ldquo;Mozart opera&rdquo;
we feel rather more certain that his next work, <i>Ariadne
auf Naxos</i> comes closer to filling that bill.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The development of this work hangs together with
production in Stuttgart, October 25, 1912, of a German
adaptation by Hofmannsthal of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s comedy
<i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>. Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s Monsieur
Jourdain, who has made money, induces a certain
charming widow, the Marquise Dorim&egrave;ne, to come
to a dinner he gives in her honor. A reprobate noble,
Count Dorantes, tells the Marquise that the soir&eacute;e at
Jourdain&rsquo;s home is really intended as a gesture of
admiration for her. M. Jourdain has engaged two
companies of singers who are supposed to perform a
serious opera, <i>Ariadne on Naxos</i>, and a burlesque, <i>The
Unfaithful Zerbinetta and Her Four Lovers</i>. Both
pieces are supposed to have been composed by a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of M. Jourdain. During a dinner scene Strauss
has recourse to bits of musical quotation&mdash;a fragment
of Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Rheingold</i> when Rhine salmon is
served and several bars of the bleating sheep music
from <i>Don Quixote</i> when servants bring in roast
mutton. The banquet is interrupted and Jourdain finds
it necessary to curtail the scheduled program. As a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
result the young author is commanded by Jourdain
to combine his two works as best he can!</p>
<p>Hofmannsthal&rsquo;s Moli&egrave;re adaptation (in which the
operatic part takes the place of the French poet&rsquo;s
original &ldquo;Turkish ceremony&rdquo;) was a clumsy, indeed
an impractical distortion. But Strauss had no intention
of sacrificing his composition without at least an
attempt to salvage something from the wreck. The
<i>Ariadne</i> portion as well as the <i>Zerbinetta</i> companion
piece were preserved but carefully detached from the
Moli&egrave;re comedy. In place of this Strauss and Hofmannsthal
supplied a sort of explanatory prologue
whereby arrangements are made for better or worse
to combine the stylized <i>opera seria</i> about Ariadne
and her rescue on a desert island by the god Bacchus,
with the comic doings of Zerbinetta and her <i>commedia
del arte</i> companions. In this shape the piece has succeeded
in surviving and actually makes an engaging
entertainment, with the young composer (a trousered
soprano) reminding one of a lesser Octavian.</p>
<p>There is considerable charming music in what is
left of the originally involved and over lengthy
entertainment. First of all, Strauss was suddenly to
renounce the huge, overloaded orchestra of <i>Salome</i>,
<i>Elektra</i> and <i>Rosenkavalier</i> and to supplant it by a
much smaller one designed for a transparent texture
of chamber music. In any case, the definitive <i>Ariadne
auf Naxos</i> is a real achievement and stands among
Strauss&rsquo;s better and more memorable accomplishments.
In the estimation of the present writer the
tenderer romantic portions of the piece excel the
comic pages associated with Zerbinetta and her merry
crew. In writing these the composer aimed to be
Mozartean (or, if one prefers, Rossinian) by assigning
the colorature soprano a florid rondo of incredible
difficulties&mdash;so mercilessly exacting, indeed, that
it first moved Hofmannsthal to discreet protest. Eventually,
the composer took steps to modify some of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
cruel problems of Zerbinetta&rsquo;s solo and it is in this
amended form that one generally hears this air today,
when it is sung as a concert number.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>It would not be altogether excessive to claim that
<i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> marks a midpoint in Strauss&rsquo;s
career. He still had a long and fruitful life ahead of
him and, as it was to prove, he was almost incorrigibly
prolific not hesitating to experiment with one type of
composition as well as another. On the eve of the
First World War he became interested in Diaghilew&rsquo;s
Russian Ballet and the various types of choreographic
and scenic art which it was to engender. Hofmannsthal
wanted him to occupy his imagination and &ldquo;to let
the vision of one of the grandest episodes of antique
tragedy, namely the subject of Orestes and the Furies,
inspire you to write a symphonic poem, which might
be a synthesis, of your symphonies and your two
tragic operas!&rdquo; And the poet adjured him to think of
Orestes as represented by Nijinsky, &ldquo;the greatest mimic
genius on the stage today!&rdquo; But apparently Strauss
had had his fill of the <i>Elektra</i> tragedy at this stage
and had no stomach for more of this sort of thing,
whether symphonic or operatic. So he remained unmoved
by Hofmannsthal&rsquo;s urgings. Yet the Russian
Ballet gave him a new idea. He thought of a pantomimic
ballet conceived in the shapes and the colors
of the epoch of Paolo Veronese.</p>
<p>From this conception, based on a scenario by a
Count Harry Kessler and von Hofmannsthal dealing
with the story of Joseph and Potiphar&rsquo;s Wife, there
grew the <i>Legend of Joseph</i>, first produced in Paris
with extraordinary scenic and decorative accouterments
on May 14, 1914. The staging was a pictorial
triumph which, though the ballet was several times
performed elsewhere, appears never to have been
anything like the visual feast it was at its first showing.
The score seems to have missed fire and has
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
never been reckoned among the composer&rsquo;s major
exploits. None the less the effect of the music
in its proper frame and context is compelling. What
if much of it sounds like discarded leavings from
&ldquo;Salome&rdquo;? Strauss confessed that from the first the
pious Joseph bored him, &ldquo;and I have difficulty in
finding music for whatever bores me&rdquo; (&ldquo;was mich
mopst&rdquo;). To &ldquo;his dear da Ponte&rdquo;, as he came to call
Hofmannsthal, he gave hope and said frankly that
though the virtuous Biblical youth tried his patience,
in the end some &ldquo;holy&rdquo; strain might perhaps
occur to him. The present writer has always felt
that the <i>Josefslegende</i> is a far too maligned work and
that it would repay a conductor to disentomb the
grossly slandered score, which when properly presented
is striking &ldquo;theatre&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On October 28, 1915, there was heard in Berlin,
under the composer&rsquo;s direction, the first symphony
(in contradiction to &ldquo;tone poem&rdquo;) Richard Strauss
had written since 1886. Like <i>Aus Italien</i> it was
again outspokenly pictorial. The composer himself
wrote titles into the divisions of the score (which he is
said to have begun to sketch in 1911, though the music
was set down to the final double bar four years later).
Some spoke of the <i>Alpensymphonie</i> as a work which
&ldquo;a child could understand&rdquo;. And the various scenic
divisions of this Alpine panorama, distended as it
undoubtedly is, can be described as plainly pictorial.
The orchestra depicts successively &ldquo;Night&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo;,
the &ldquo;Ascent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Entrance into the Forest&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wandering
besides the Brook&rdquo;, &ldquo;At the Waterfall&rdquo;, &ldquo;Apparition&rdquo;,
&ldquo;On Flowery Meadows&rdquo;, &ldquo;On the Alm&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lost
in the Thicket&rdquo;, &ldquo;On the Glacier&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dangerous Moment&rdquo;,
&ldquo;On the Summit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mists Rise&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Sun is
gradually hidden&rdquo;, &ldquo;Elegy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Calm before the Storm&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Thunderstorm&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Descent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo;, &ldquo;Night&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On account of its length the &ldquo;Alpine Symphony&rdquo;
has never been a favorite among Strauss&rsquo;s achievements
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
of tone painting. Indeed, it may be questioned
whether its sunrise scene can be compared for suggestiveness
and purely musical thrill to the glorious
opening picture of <i>Also Sprach Zarathustra</i>.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Strauss&rsquo;s symphonic excursion in the Alps was succeeded
by a return to opera. Between 1914 and 1917
(which is to say during the most poignant years of
the First War) he busied himself with a work which
was to become a child of sorrow to him but which
to a number of his staunchest worshippers often passes
as one of his very finest achievements&mdash;<i>Die Frau
ohne Schatten</i> (<i>The Woman Without a Shadow</i>), first
performed under Frank Schalk in Vienna, October
10, 1919. For all the enthusiasm it evokes in some of
the inner Straussian circles this opera, which combines
length, breadth and thickness, is a real problem.
The writer of these lines, who has been exposed to
the work fully half a dozen times always with a firm
resolve to enjoy it, has never succeeded in his ambition.
Though Strauss and Hofmannsthal discussed the
plans for the piece in 1912 and once more in 1914
the first act was not finished till that year; and war
held up the completion of the opera three years more.</p>
<p>It has been maintained that in <i>Die Frau ohne Schatten</i>
marks &ldquo;the combination of a recitative style with
the forms of the older opera&rdquo; and that in it Strauss
has yielded to a mystical tendency. Willy Brandl
claims that Hofmannsthal&rsquo;s libretto attracted the
composer and stimulated him &ldquo;precisely because of
its obscurity&rdquo;; that he saw in it a series of problems
to be &ldquo;clarified, not to say unveiled, in their complexities
precisely through the agency of music.&rdquo; The question
of motherhood lies at the root of the opera.
Hofmannsthal saw in his poem a &ldquo;kind of continuation
of <i>The Magic Flute</i>. On one hand we have the
superterrestrial worlds, on another the realistic scenes
of the human world bound together by the demonic
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
figure of the Nurse. And a new element is to be sensed
in the score&mdash;the powerful, hymn-like character of
the music overpoweringly disclosed in the music, a
new feature in Strauss&rsquo;s compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be questioned whether Strauss was truly
content with the bloodless symbolism which fills <i>The
Woman Without a Shadow</i>. In any case at this juncture
he began to long for something new. Somehow
Hofmannsthal did not at that moment appear to be
reacting sympathetically to the dramatic demands
which just then seemed to be filling Strauss&rsquo;s mind.
He informed Hofmannsthal that he longed for something
to compose like Schnitzler&rsquo;s <i>Liebelei</i> or Scribe&rsquo;s
<i>Glass of Water</i>. He asked for &ldquo;characters inviting
composition&mdash;characters like the Marschallin, Ochs
or Barak (in <i>Die Frau ohne Schatten</i>).&rdquo; And so, when
Hofmannsthal did not &ldquo;respond&rdquo; promptly he took up
the pen to work out his own salvation. The consequence
was <i>Intermezzo</i>, a domestic comedy in one act
with symphonic interludes. It was produced at the
Dresden Opera, November 4, 1924, under Fritz Busch.
Two years before that Strauss had presented in Vienna
a two act Viennese ballet, <i>Schlagobers</i> (<i>Whipped
Cream</i>) which can be dismissed as one of his outspoken
failures. As for <i>Intermezzo</i> it had biographical
vibrations in that it pictured a domestic episode in
Strauss&rsquo;s own experiences. It had to do with a conductor,
<i>Robert Storch</i>, and thus Strauss could make
amusing stage use of the unmistakable initials &ldquo;R.S.&rdquo;
and make various allusions to the game of skat, which
had for years been a favorite diversion of his. The
music of <i>Intermezzo</i> has never been acclaimed a product
of the greater Strauss. And yet Alfred Lorenz,
famous for his series of eviscerating studies of the
structural problems of Wagner&rsquo;s music dramas, has
made it clear that the Wagnerian form problems are
likewise the principles which underlie such a relatively
tenuous Straussian score as <i>Intermezzo</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>In spite of the dubious fortunes which were to dog
the steps of an opera like <i>The Woman Without a
Shadow</i> the composer once again allowed himself to
be seduced by a work of relatively similar character,
<i>Egyptian Helen</i>, a somewhat tortured mythical tale,
based on a rather far-fetched &ldquo;magic&rdquo; fiction by
von Hofmannsthal, relating to a phase of the Trojan
war, in which Helen is shown as wholly innocent of
the ancient struggle. Magic befuddlements, potions
capable of changing the characteristics of people,
draughts which rob this or that personage of his
memory, an &ldquo;omniscient shell&rdquo; which launches oracular
pronouncements and a good deal more of the
sort lend a singular character to the strange fantasy, in
which some have chosen to discern a kind of take-off
on the various drinks of forgetfulness and such in
<i>Tristan</i> and <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>. <i>Egyptian Helen</i> is the
only sample of this strange stage of the Strauss who
was reaching the frontiers of old age which American
music lovers had the opportunity to know. It would
be excessive to claim that, either in Europe or in the
western hemisphere, the work was a noticeable addition
to the enduring accomplishments of the master.
More than one began to obtain the impression that,
for all the splendors of his technic Strauss seemed to be
going to seed.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In the summer of 1929 Hofmannsthal suddenly
died. Some time before he had written a short novel,
<i>Lucidor</i>, about an impoverished family with two marriageable
daughters for whom an attempt is made to
secure wealthy husbands. To facilitate the marital
stratagem one of the daughters is dressed in boy&rsquo;s
clothes. The disguised girl falls in love with a suitor
of her sister, Arabella, to whom one Mandryka, a
romantic Balkan youth of great wealth, pays court.
The period is the year 1860, the scene Vienna.</p>
<p>Inevitably, <i>Arabella</i> turned out to be something of
a throwback into the scene, if not the glamorous
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
period or milieu, of <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>. Almost inevitably,
the lyric comedy&mdash;the final product of the
Strauss-Hofmannsthal partnership&mdash;is filled with
scenes, characters and analogies to the more famous
work. In truth, <i>Arabella</i> is a kind of little sister of
<i>Rosenkavalier</i>. At the same time the texture of the
score and the character of the orchestral treatment
has a transparency and a delicate charm which Strauss
rarely equalled, even if the melodic invention and the
instrumentation suggest a kind of chamber music on
a large scale. As in <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> the composer
does not hesitate to make use of a florid soprano to
introduce scintillating samples of ornate vocalism.
One feels, however, that <i>Arabella</i> is a semi-finished
product. The second half of the work does
not sustain the level of the first. Many things might
have been worked out more expertly if the librettist
had been spared to supervise work, which as things
stand is far from a really satisfactory or unified piece.
But the score contains some of the older Strauss&rsquo;s
most enamoring lyric pages and it is easy to feel that
his heart was in the better portions of the opera. The
score of <i>Arabella</i> benefits by the introduction of folk-songs
influence&mdash;in this instance of a number of
South Slavic melodies, which are among its genuine
treasures.</p>
<p>Lacking his faithful Hofmannsthal Strauss turned
to Stefan Zweig, who had made for him an operatic
adaptation of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s play, &ldquo;Epicoene, or The
Silent Woman&rdquo;. On June 24, 1935, it was produced
under Karl B&ouml;hm at the Dresden Opera. At once
trouble arose. Hitler and the Nazis had come into
power and Zweig, as a Jew, was automatically an
outcast. After the very first performances the piece
was forbidden, not to be revived till after Hitler&rsquo;s end
(and then in Munich and in Wiesbaden). It is actually
a question whether the temporary loss of <i>Die Schweigsame
Frau</i> must be accounted a serious deprivation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
<i>The Silent Woman</i> is a rowdy, cruel farce about the
tricks played on a wretched old man, unable to endure
noise and subjected to all manner of torments in order
that he be compelled to renounce a young woman,
who to assure a lover a monetary settlement, plays
the shrew so successfully that the old man is only
too willing to pay any amount of his wealth to be
rid of her. It is much like the story of Donizetti&rsquo;s
<i>Don Pasquale</i> and the dramatic consequences are
to all intents the same. There is, in reality, nothing
serious or genuinely based on musical <i>inspiration</i>
in the opera, the best features of which are certain
set pieces (some rather adroitly polyphonic) and a
charmingly orchestrated overture described in the
score as a &ldquo;potpourri&rdquo;. A tenderer note is struck only
at the point where, as evening falls, the old man drops
off to sleep.</p>
<p>As librettist for his next two operas, <i>Friedenstag</i>
and <i>Daphne</i>, Strauss sought the aid of Joseph Gregor.
The first named work (in one act) was performed on
July 7, 1938, in Munich, under Clemens Krauss.
Ironically enough this work that aimed to glorify
the coming of peace after conflict, was first performed
with the political troubles which heralded the outbreak
of the Second World War, visibly shaping themselves.
<i>Daphne</i>, bucolic tragedy in a single act, also from
the pen of Gregor, was heard in Dresden, October 15,
1938. And Gregor, too, supplied the aging composer,
with the book of <i>Die Liebe der Danae</i>, a &ldquo;merry
mythological tale&rdquo; in three acts. To date its sole production
to date seems to have been in Salzburg, as a
&ldquo;dress rehearsal&rdquo;, August 16, 1944.</p>
<p>Strauss&rsquo;s last opera (produced under Clemens Krauss
in Munich on October 28, 1942), was <i>Capriccio</i>, &ldquo;a
conversation piece for music&rdquo;, in one act. Krauss and
the composer collaborating on the book. The &ldquo;conversation&rdquo;
is a discussion of certain aesthetic problems
underlying the musical treatment of operatic
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
texts. It was the final work of operatic character Strauss
was to attempt. This did not mean, however, that he
had written his last score. Far from it! At 81 he
was to complete several, the real value of which may
be left to the judgment of posterity. They include
some songs, a duet-concertino for clarinet and bassoon
with strings, a concerto for oboe and orchestra,
a still unperformed concert fragment for orchestra
from the <i>Legend of Joseph</i>. More important, unquestionably,
is <i>Metamorphoses</i>, a &ldquo;study for 23 solo
strings&rdquo;, first played in Zurich, January 25, 1946
under the direction of Paul Sacher. This work, despite
its length, is music of suave, beautiful texture;
a certain nobly nostalgic quality of farewell which
seems to sum up the composer&rsquo;s life work, with all
its ups and downs. We may allow it to go at this
and to spare further enumeration of the innumerable
odds and ends he was to assemble from his boyhood
to the patriarchal age of more than 85 years; or even
to allude to his gross derangement of Mozart&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Idomeneo&rdquo;, done in 1930 at Munich.</p>
<p>Having lived through a lively young manhood
and endured the bitter experience of two world
wars Richard Strauss in the end performed the
miracle of actually dying of old age! One might
almost have looked for convulsions of nature, for
signs and portents at his eventual passing. But his
going was to be accompanied by no such things. His
death in Garmisch, September 8, 1949, was brought
about by the illnesses of the flesh at more than four
score and five. He died of a complication of heart,
liver and kidney troubles&mdash;and he died in his bed!
A Heldenleben, if you will! And a death and
transfiguration played against the loveliest conceivable
background&mdash;an incomparable stage setting of
Alpine lakes and heights, with streams and gleaming
summits furnishing a glorious backdrop for his resting
place!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
